    <h1>Economics</h1>
    <p>
      This section focuses on economic prosperity, scale, and distribution: how GDP per capita relates to billionaire concentration,
      how population compares as an explanatory factor, which countries dominate total wealth, and how unequal billionaire net worth is within the population.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The pattern indicates that higher GDP per capita is generally associated with more billionaires, suggesting that prosperous economies provide more opportunities for scalable value creation. Insight 2: The relationship is not perfectly linear, and outliers show that prosperity alone does not guarantee billionaire concentration—other factors (like institutions and industry mix) likely influence outcomes. Insight 3: This visualization supports the economic hypothesis that wealth creation at the extreme tail tends to be more common in high-income environments, but it also highlights the need to consider institutional quality and market structure.

    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: This chart shows that population size alone is a weak predictor of billionaire count, since some large countries do not host proportional billionaire populations while some smaller countries host many. Insight 2: The mismatch suggests that the quality of economic structure and capital formation matters more than raw population scale for producing extreme wealth. Insight 3: When interpreted alongside GDP per capita, the population view helps separate “big country effects” from true wealth-ecosystem effects, strengthening the argument that prosperity and institutions matter more than size.

    <h2>Viz E3 · Top 15 Countries by Total Billionaire Wealth</h2>

    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The ranking highlights that global billionaire wealth is heavily concentrated among a small number of countries, indicating strong “winner-take-most” dynamics across national ecosystems. Insight 2: The steep drop after the top tier implies that wealth dominance is driven by a few highly influential markets and industries rather than being widely shared globally. Insight 3: This chart complements the GDP and population relationships by showing that even if many countries have billionaires, only a few capture a large share of total billionaire wealth.

    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The distribution demonstrates extreme inequality even among billionaires, with outliers that sit far above the typical individual in the dataset. Insight 2: The log scale helps reveal structure in the “middle” of the billionaire range that would otherwise be hidden by the largest fortunes. Insight 3: This matters because national “total wealth” can be dominated by a small number of mega-fortunes, so country-level totals reflect both how many billionaires exist and how concentrated wealth is among them.
