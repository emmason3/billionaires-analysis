      <h1>Billionaires, Prosperity, and Institutions: A Global Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        This dashboard summarizes how billionaire concentration varies across countries and how it relates to
        economic prosperity (GDP per capita), institutional quality (CPI), and the composition of wealth by industry and gender.
        The goal is not only to display patterns, but to interpret what those patterns imply about where extreme wealth tends to form and scale.

        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          This map shows that billionaires are not evenly distributed worldwide. Instead, they cluster in a small number of countries,
          indicating that extreme wealth tends to emerge where large markets, deep financial systems, and global capital networks exist.
          The wide presence of near-zero regions also highlights that billionaire formation is not just about population; it depends on economic
          structure and access to scalable opportunities.

          Total billionaire wealth is even more concentrated than billionaire counts. Some countries may have many billionaires, but the wealth
          map reveals where the largest fortunes accumulate and compound. The strongest outliers suggest that national ecosystems can amplify wealth
          at scale through factors like capital markets, technology platforms, and high-growth industries.

        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          This visualization integrates three core variables: GDP per capita (prosperity), CPI (institutional quality), and billionaire count.
          A general upward pattern suggests that wealthier countries tend to host more billionaires, but CPI helps explain why some countries convert
          prosperity into sustained wealth accumulation more effectively than others. Outliers matter: they indicate that prosperity alone is not
          sufficient, and that governance, market design, and investor confidence can significantly influence billionaire ecosystems.

      <div class="insights">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          The ranking view makes the degree of concentration immediately visible: wealth drops sharply after the top tier.
          This matters because it shows that a handful of national ecosystems account for a disproportionate share of global private wealth.
          The long tail also suggests that many countries have billionaire presence, but not at the scale that changes global totals.

      <div class="insights">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          The treemap shows that billionaire wealth is not only concentrated geographically, but also structurally concentrated across industries.
          Large blocks indicate sectors that scale rapidly or benefit from strong network effects, capital intensity, or global demand.
          Interpreting this alongside the country maps suggests that nations hosting dominant industries (such as technology, finance, and energy)
          are more likely to produce very large fortunes, not just more billionaires.

      <div class="insights">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          This chart complements the wealth ranking by focusing on the size of the billionaire population. Countries can rank high in counts but
          lower in total wealth if their billionaire class is larger but less top-heavy. Comparing this chart with total wealth helps distinguish
          “many fortunes” from “mega-fortunes,” which is crucial for understanding different national wealth structures.

      <div class="insights">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          The relationship between CPI and total billionaire wealth suggests that institutional quality often supports long-term wealth accumulation.
          Higher CPI can reflect more predictable rule enforcement, stronger investor protections, and lower transaction frictions, which encourages
          capital formation. However, exceptions remind us that wealth can form under many conditions; the key takeaway is that institutions may be
          especially important for scaling and preserving wealth over time.

      <div class="insights">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          The gender distribution reveals a strong representation gap at the top of the wealth hierarchy. This is meaningful because it signals that
          barriers to wealth creation and ownership persist even at the most extreme levels of economic success. Interpreting this alongside industry
          and country patterns can help frame whether certain ecosystems are more inclusive or whether structural inequality remains consistent across contexts.

      <div class="insights">
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          The box plot shows that billionaire wealth is highly skewed for all groups, with extreme outliers driving much of the total wealth.
          Even if representation differs, the key analytical point is that “billionaire” spans a wide wealth spectrum, from modest billions to mega-fortunes.
          This helps interpret total wealth maps: a country’s billionaire wealth can be dominated by a small number of individuals rather than broad participation.
