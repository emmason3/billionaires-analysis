    <h1>Billionaires, Prosperity, and Institutions: A Global Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      This project explores where billionaire wealth is concentrated globally and what national characteristics are associated with that concentration.
      The homepage introduces the overall geographic and structural patterns; deeper economic, institutional, and gender analyses are organized on the pages below.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The map shows billionaire presence clustering in a small number of countries, suggesting that extreme wealth is tied to specific national ecosystems rather than being evenly distributed. Insight 2: Many countries appear with very low or zero counts, indicating that population size alone cannot explain billionaire formation without the right economic and institutional conditions. Insight 3: This chart sets the baseline for the project by identifying where billionaire networks exist before examining why those environments may support wealth accumulation.

    <h2>Viz 02 · Total Billionaire Wealth by Country</h2>
    <div class="meta">Choropleth map — total billionaire wealth (trillions USD scale)</div>
    <iframe src="charts/viz02_total_wealth_trillions_map.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: Total wealth is even more concentrated than billionaire counts, showing that a few countries host not just more billionaires but also the largest fortunes. Insight 2: Comparing this map to Viz 01 distinguishes “many billionaires” from “mega-fortunes,” which matters because a small number of individuals can dominate national totals. Insight 3: The wealth map motivates deeper analysis into which economic and institutional factors help countries scale billionaire wealth rather than simply produce more wealthy individuals.

    <h2>Viz 08 · Billionaire Wealth by Industry</h2>
    <div class="meta">Treemap — which industries generate the most billionaire wealth</div>
    <iframe src="charts/viz08_treemap_industry.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The treemap reveals that billionaire wealth is structurally concentrated in a subset of industries, meaning the “source” of extreme wealth is not evenly spread across the economy. Insight 2: Larger blocks represent sectors where scale, network effects, capital intensity, or global demand can amplify fortunes, helping explain why certain countries dominate the wealth map. Insight 3: This chart bridges the geography of wealth (maps) with the economic mechanisms behind wealth creation, setting up the Economics page to explore prosperity and scale more directly.
