    <h1>Institutions (Corruption / CPI)</h1>
    <p>
      This section examines institutional quality using CPI. The core question is whether stronger institutions (higher CPI / lower perceived corruption)
      are associated with more billionaire presence and higher billionaire wealth, which may reflect stronger property rights, lower friction for investment, and predictable rule enforcement.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The chart suggests a tendency for higher CPI (cleaner institutions) to align with larger billionaire populations, consistent with the idea that stable institutions support entrepreneurship and capital growth. Insight 2: The presence of exceptions indicates that billionaires can emerge under varied conditions, but the overall pattern implies institutions may affect the scale and stability of wealth ecosystems. Insight 3: This relationship is meaningful because it highlights how non-economic variables—like governance quality—may shape the environment where extreme private wealth forms and persists.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: This plot connects institutional quality to the total scale of billionaire wealth, suggesting that cleaner institutions often correlate with higher wealth totals, not just more individuals. Insight 2: Countries with high wealth but weaker CPI can be interpreted as cases where resource concentration, market structure, or political economy allows wealth formation, even if institutions introduce risk or inequality. Insight 3: Together with CPI vs count, this chart helps distinguish whether institutions relate more to producing many billionaires or enabling a smaller set of mega-fortunes to grow and compound.
