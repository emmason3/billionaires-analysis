    <h1>Gender</h1>
    <p>
      This section evaluates gender representation among billionaires, how net worth differs across genders, and how female billionaire share varies across countries.
      These patterns provide a lens on inequality at the extreme upper tail of the wealth distribution.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The composition chart shows a strong representation gap, indicating that billionaire status is overwhelmingly held by men in this dataset. Insight 2: This gap is meaningful because it suggests unequal access to pathways that generate extreme wealth, such as ownership, scaling businesses, and capital networks. Insight 3: Interpreting this alongside country and industry structures suggests gender inequality may persist across many wealth ecosystems rather than being isolated to a single region or sector.

    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: The wealth distributions show large variation within each gender group, indicating that billionaire wealth spans a wide range rather than representing a single level of fortune. Insight 2: Outliers matter because a small number of individuals can drive much of the total wealth, affecting interpretations of country-level totals and inequality. Insight 3: This chart adds depth beyond representation by focusing on wealth magnitude, showing that inequality exists not only in counts but also in the structure of wealth holdings.

    <iframe src="charts/vizG3_female_share_dark.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: Female share varies substantially by country, implying that representation at the top tail depends on local economic, cultural, and institutional conditions. Countries that tend to be more liberal and less conservative such as France, Italy, Sweden and Germany have a higher proportion of female billionares while countries like Russia and China have much smaller proportions. Insight 2: Some countries may have a small billionaire population but a relatively higher female share, suggesting that inclusion and access can differ from sheer billionaire concentration. Insight 3: This chart is important for interpretation because it prevents the gender story from being purely global-average; it identifies where gender gaps appear narrower or wider and encourages explanation grounded in national contexts.
