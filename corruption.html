    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>
      This chart compares CPI scores with total billionaire wealth by country, showing that higher CPI (lower perceived corruption) often coincides with larger pools of billionaire wealth, while also highlighting exceptions where wealth accumulates even under weaker institutional conditions.

    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>
      This visualization tests whether cleaner institutions are associated with more billionaires overall, helping separate “more wealth per billionaire” patterns from simple differences in billionaire population size across countries.

  <div class="insights">
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>
      Normalizing billionaire wealth by population makes cross-country comparisons fairer and can reveal smaller countries that “punch above their weight” in wealth concentration, even if their total wealth is lower in absolute terms.

  <div class="insights">
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>
      Looking at average wealth per billionaire focuses on how concentrated fortunes are within each country’s billionaire class, which can differ substantially from patterns in billionaire count or total billionaire wealth.

  <h2>Viz • CPI vs Billionaire Wealth Share of GDP</h2>

  <div class="insights">
    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>
      Expressing billionaire wealth relative to national GDP reframes the question from “who has the most billionaires” to “how dominant billionaire wealth is inside the economy,” which can surface high-concentration countries that are otherwise overlooked.
