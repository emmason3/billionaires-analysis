        <p>
          This chart compares CPI scores with total billionaire wealth by country, suggesting that higher CPI (lower perceived corruption)
          often coincides with larger pools of billionaire wealth because stable rules and predictable investment climates help large fortunes
          scale over time. At the same time, a few high-wealth outliers at lower CPI scores show that extreme wealth can still accumulate in
          weaker institutional contexts, especially when specific sectors dominate or market power is highly concentrated. Overall, CPI is not a
          single “cause” of billionaire wealth, but it is a meaningful contextual factor that helps explain why some countries are better at
          sustaining large, compounding wealth totals than others.

        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>
          Countries with higher CPI scores frequently host more billionaires, consistent with the idea that stronger institutions reduce friction
          for entrepreneurship, scaling businesses, and attracting investment. However, the relationship is not perfectly linear: some countries
          with moderate CPI still show meaningful billionaire presence, implying that market size, industry mix, and policy also shape billionaire
          concentration. The overall pattern supports a balanced conclusion: governance quality appears to be an important enabling condition for
          building a broader billionaire ecosystem, even if it does not fully determine where every billionaire is located.

        Note: CPI is perception-based and should be interpreted as a comparative indicator rather than a direct measure of actual corruption.
