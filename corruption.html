    <h1>Corruption (CPI)</h1>
    <p>
      This page focuses on the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and what it suggests about the relationship between perceived corruption and
      billionaire concentration. CPI is a widely used, country-level indicator published by Transparency International and is useful for comparing
      governance environments across nations.

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: This visualization suggests that countries with higher CPI scores (lower perceived corruption) often have higher billionaire counts,
        consistent with the idea that predictable rules and stronger investor confidence can support entrepreneurship and large-scale wealth creation.
        Insight 2: The relationship is not perfectly linear and there are notable exceptions, meaning billionaires can emerge across a range of governance
        contexts; however, the overall clustering pattern implies that cleaner governance may be especially important for sustaining larger billionaire
        ecosystems rather than isolated cases. Insight 3: Viewed alongside economic measures, this chart helps separate “wealth presence” from “wealth
        scalability,” highlighting that governance conditions may influence how efficiently countries translate business growth into many high-net-worth individuals.

    <div class="insights">
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Insight 1: Comparing CPI to total billionaire wealth emphasizes that governance may relate not only to how many billionaires a country has, but also
        to the magnitude of fortunes that can accumulate and compound over time. Insight 2: Countries that show high wealth totals despite lower CPI scores
        illustrate that extreme wealth can still form under weaker perceived governance, possibly through resource concentration, highly centralized industries,
        or market power; these cases are important because they show institutions can shape different pathways to wealth rather than acting as a simple on/off switch.
        Insight 3: Taken together with the CPI vs count chart, this figure helps distinguish broad billionaire participation from top-heavy wealth concentration,
        clarifying whether governance conditions align more strongly with having many billionaires or with producing a small number of mega-fortunes.

    Note: CPI is perception-based and should be interpreted as a comparative indicator rather than a direct measure of actual corruption.
